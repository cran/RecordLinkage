\title{
  Estimate Threshold from Pareto Distribution
}
\description{
  Calculates a classification threshold based on a generalized Pareto 
  distribution (GPD) fitted to the weights distribution of the given data pairs.
}

\usage{
getParetoThreshold(rpairs, quantil = 0.95, interval = NA)
\S4method{getParetoThreshold}{RecLinkData}(rpairs, quantil = 0.95, interval = NA)
\S4method{getParetoThreshold}{RLBigData}(rpairs, quantil = 0.95, interval = NA)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{rpairs}{
    A \code{"\link{RecLinkData}"} or \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigData}"} object with weights.
    The data for which to compute a threshold.
}

  \item{quantil}{
    A real number between 0 and 1. The quantile which to compute.
}
  \item{interval}{
    A numeric vector denoting the interval on which to fit
    a GPD.
}
}

\details{
  This threshold calculation is based on the assumption that the distribution 
  of weights exhibit a `fat tail' which can be fitted by a generalized Pareto 
  distribution (GPD). The limits of the interval which is subject to the
  fitting are usually determined by reviewing a mean residual life plot of
  the data. If the limits are not externally supplied, a MRL plot is displayed 
  from which the endpoints   can be selected by mouse input. If only one endpoint 
  is selected or supplied, the greater endpoint is set to the maximum weight.
  
  A suitable interval is characterized by a relatively long, approximately 
  linear segment of the plot.
