\details{
  This function calculates weights for record pairs based on the approach
  used by Contiero et al. in the EpiLink record linkage software (see references).

  Since package version 0.3, this is a generic function with methods for
  S3 objects of class \code{"\link[=RecLinkData.object]{RecLinkData}"}
  as well as S4 objects of classes \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigDataDedup}"} and
  \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigDataLinkage}"}.

  The weight for a record pair \eqn{(x^{1},x^{2})}{(x1,x2)} is computed by
  the formula 
  \deqn{\frac{\sum_{i}w_{i}s(x^{1}_{i},x^{2}_{i})}{\sum_{i}w_{i}}}{sum_i (w_1 * s(x1_i, x2_i)) / sum_i w_i}
  where \eqn{s(x^{1}_{i},x^{2}_{i})}{s(x1_i, x2_i)} is the value of a string comparison of
  records \eqn{x^{1}}{x1} and \eqn{x^{2}}{x2} in the i-th field and 
  \eqn{w_{i}}{w_i} is a weighting factor computed by 
  \deqn{w_{i}=\log_{2}(1-e_{i})/f_{i}}{w_i = log_2 (1-e_i) / f_i}
   where \eqn{f_{i}}{f_i} denotes the
  average frequency of values and \eqn{e_{i}}{e_i} the estimated error rate
  for field \eqn{i}. 
  
  String comparison values are taken from the record pairs as they were
  generated with \code{\link{compare.dedup}} or \code{\link{compare.linkage}}.
  The use of binary patterns is possible, but in general yields poor results.
  
  The average frequency of values is by default taken from the object
  \code{rpairs}. Both frequency and error rate \code{e} can be set to a single 
  value, which will be recycled, or to a vector with distinct error rates for 
  every field. 
  
  The error rate(s) and frequencie(s) must satisfy 
  \eqn{e_{i}\leq{}1-f_{i}}{e[i] <= 1-f[i]} for all \eqn{i}, otherwise
  the functions fails. Also, some other rare combinations can result in weights
  with illegal values (NaN, less than 0 or greater than 1). In this case a
  warning is issued.
  
  By default, the \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigDataDedup}"} method displays a
  progress bar unless output is diverted by \code{sink}, e.g. when processing
  a Sweave file.
}

\value{
  A copy of \code{rpairs} with the weights attached. See the class documentation
  (\code{"\link[=RecLinkData.object]{RecLinkData}"}, \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigDataDedup}"} and
  \code{"\linkS4class{RLBigDataLinkage}"}) on how weights are stored.
  
  For the \code{"RLBigData"} method, the returned object is only a shallow
  copy in the sense that it links to the same ff data files as database file as
  \code{rpairs}.
}

\section{Side effects}{
  The \code{"RLBigData"} method creates a \code{"ffvector"} object,
  for which a disk file is created.
